This directory contains scripts and output data of pngs of the STRAW data

I was looking for a good choice of 'low' noise times for my coincidence analysis so I plotted datafiles on the lowest threshold for both the upward
and downward PMTs by the ms. The png files of these plots are in this dir

The `scripts/` directory contains the scripts I used to generate the files 
The tar file contains two directories of png plots.
	The `ylim_pdfs/` directory contains plots where the y-axis was restricted to bettter show the lower noise times.
	The `pdfs/` directory contains plots where nothing is restricted.

Each png has the file that it came from in the title of the plot and the upward pmt plots have a different color than the downward pmt plots so it is
easier to just glance at the photos.


If you decide that you don't care to have these plots, delete the directory. If someone needs them later it isn't too hard to just generate them again
