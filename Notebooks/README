This directory contains jupyter notebooks used to analyze the data found in the other directories.
Note: FILE PATHS ARE WRONG in notebooks but I have put directions to find the correct path in the notebook
A brief descritption of each notebook can be found below:

Coincidence_analysis:

Parsed Analysis.ipynb: Plots of the STRAW data coincidences found in the `parsing/` directory of 
mens/Coincidence_analysis/parsing along with calculations of the salinity 
based on the values found in this notebook.
The effective volume was found from the Calculate_Veff notebook described below

oldPocam.ipynb: Plots of old Pocam coincidence data, an attempt was done to analyze detector
efficiency over time but it was unfinished. See oldPocam instruction file.

Arrival_time: Plots to try and get a better smearing time from the sDOM (closer to 7ns instead
of the 3.5ns TTS). Work in this notebook is unfinished

G4:

Angular Acceptance.ipynb: Code for plotting the angular acceptance of the simulated sDOM,
for the data used in this analysis see the angular_acceptance simulation

Calculate Veff.ipynb: Code for calculating the effective volume from the absorption simulation. 
Data must have QE applied before calculating the effective volume 

Match Sim to Data.ipynb: Code to check that my geant4 simulation matches with what we see in 
the STRAW data

Photon Energies.ipynb: Plots for the output photon energies. Extra code was added at the end to check
the absorption lengths being added into the simulation

QE script.ipynb: The code to get the QE of each coincident hit in the absorption simulation
This notebook should be used to take a simulation's data and prepare it for analysis as the 
simulation itself does nothing about the Quantum efficency. This could also be turned into
a script but has not been done yet

Simulated Coincidences.ipynb: Look at the coincidence distribution of the simulated coincidences
