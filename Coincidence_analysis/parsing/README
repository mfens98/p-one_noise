This directory conatins all of the relevant work for my analysis of STRAW data. 
It is split into several subdirectories which are explained here.

The `parsing_only` directory contains scripts and files for only parsing the data. 
Parsing in this case refers to looking at a datafile and looking for times in the data where the noise rate is less than ~20mHz when binned by the millisecond. 
All of the scripts in the directory parse this way. 
There is also another directory in this subdirectory which will count how many milliseconds of data was kept in order to give a rate when plotting coincidences.
The `parsed` directory contains parsed datafiles


The `coincidences` directory contains files and scripts related to looking for coincidences in the parsed data.
The script find_preparsed_coincs will look at an already parsed datafile and find the coincdences 
whereas the python scripts in `newJulyData` and `stricter_parsing` will take an unparsed data file, parse it, then 
find the coincidences and output the coincidences from the parsed times.

The `stricter_parsing` directory contains newer parsing where I cut the maximum number of hits per ms down to 20 and above 0. It ended up being the directory which I used for my salinity calculations and the scripts that I would use to analyze more data.

The `newJulyData` directory contains the coincidence and parsing analysis for the latest datarun which was taken at the end of July 2020.
The files labeled *_all are just consolidations of the directories with the individual files.
The msCounts directory contains a count of how many milliseconds of data were analyzed so that my coincidence plots have a rate for the y-axis instead of just a count.

The `pulse_check` directory contains plots of the threshold crossing times for all (parsed) coincidences,
these plots can be found in the `pngs` directory with the coincidence time data in the `coincidenceFiles` directory.
